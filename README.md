# What is `DockerSwiftApacheCombination`?

This repository includes container image which enables you to run CGI programs written in Swift via Apache HTTP Web Server. 

The image is based on [`swift:slim`](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/swift/slim/images/sha256-9d105459cce7309770f0686bdeb44d5dce73ffbd441106e3e2ae74b176a59b81). You will need other container images (e.g. [`swift:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/swift/latest/images/sha256-b3cfba744a0d0697f7225c0f6486dd6b24f2963b0aef5e2f0d54a17da6a1d3b6)) to build your Swift programs.
